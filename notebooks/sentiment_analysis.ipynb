      "**Analysis**: The sentiment of this feedback is negative, driven primarily by feelings of being undervalued and overworked. The key emotional or thematic elements driving this sentiment are the employee's perceived lack of recognition and an excessive workload. The specific phrases \"undervalued\" and \"overworked\" are crucial in understanding the employee's dissatisfaction. The theme of being \"undervalued\" suggests that the employee feels their contributions are not recognized or appreciated, indicating a need for better recognition or respect from the organization. On the other hand, feeling \"overworked\" points to potential issues with workload management, resource allocation, or work-life balance. These themes are interconnected, as an overworked employee might also feel undervalued if their extra efforts are not acknowledged. Overall, the feedback highlights the importance of addressing recognition and workload concerns to improve employee satisfaction and well-being.\n"
